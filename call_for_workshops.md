2018 Workshop and Tutorial Proposals</span></h3>
<ul class="c10 lst-kix_gchw2g1ewor6-0 start">
<li class="c0 c7"><span class="c5">Workshop and Tutorial Day:
Saturday, October 6, 2018</span></li>
<li class="c0 c7"><span class="c5">Workshop and Tutorial
Co-Chairs: Robert Kleinberg and James R. Lee</span></li>
<li class="c0 c7"><span class="c5">Submission deadline:
&nbsp;August 1st, 2018</span></li>
<li class="c0 c7"><span class="c5">Notification: August 6th, 2018</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5"> On Saturday, October 6th, immediately
preceding the main conference, FOCS 2018 will hold a
workshop-and-tutorials day. &nbsp;We invite groups of interested
researchers to submit workshop or tutorial proposals. </span></p>
<p class="c0 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">The goal of a workshop is to provide
an informal forum for researchers to discuss important research
questions, directions, and challenges. The goal of a tutorial is
to educate TCS researchers about foundational material and
recent developments in a research area in which they may not
already be conversant. Connections between theoretical computer
science and other areas, topics that are not well represented at
FOCS, and open problems are also encouraged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">Format: The workshop/tutorial day
will start at 9am and end at 5pm with lunch from 12-2pm. &nbsp;
It will take place near the main FOCS 2018 venue. Organizers are
completely free to choose their workshop formats (invited
speakers, panel discussions, etc.). Both full-day and half-day
workshops are a possibility.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">FOCS does not have funds to cover
travel expenses or honoraria for invited workshop and tutorial
speakers. Workshop and tutorials attendance will, however, be
free and there is no separate registration for attending them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p>
